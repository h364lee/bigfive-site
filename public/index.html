    <p>
        Hello! This is a side project by Caleb Lee, created during his summer 2025 break from school.<br />
        This website allows you to take psychological tests, such as the Big Five Personality Inventory, and download your results.<br />
        The data collected here will be used solely by Caleb for practicing data analysis and research methods.<br />
        No data collected through this site will be published or shared.
